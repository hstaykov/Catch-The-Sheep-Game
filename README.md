A simple game written in HTML 5 and JS
=====
This is a test game using only HTML 5 and Java Script for rendering animation and handling user input.
The scores are stored in cloud-based DB - Firebase : https://www.firebase.com/
This is my first Java Script code so it is full of bugs and bad practices.

Any comments, crtics and contributions are welcome.
